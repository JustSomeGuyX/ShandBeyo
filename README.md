# Shand Beyo Keyboard Layout

Shand Beyo (named for homerow 'shnd' + 'beoi') is a Halmak-inspired layout optimized to split hand workload almost perfectly 50/50 while retaining hand alternation.

## Layout / Key Map

| Row | Left Hand (LH) | Right Hand (RH) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Top** | w l r f a | ;	c u t q |
| **Home** | s h n d , | . b e o i |
| **Bottom** | z m v j / | g p k y x |

## Design Philosophy / Key Metrics

The goal of Shand Beyo was to retain some of the compelling features of Halmak (homerow percentage, hand alternation, etc.) but to increase workload balance between the hands. Additionally, this layout was designed to reduce pinky strain by moving some low-frequency keys to the left and right extremes.

| Metric | Result | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hand Workload** | ≈49.8% LH / 50.2% RH | Achieves near-perfect balance, reducing strain on the Left Hand. |
| **Home Row Usage** | 58.1% | A high percentage of strokes on the comfortable Home Row, minimizing travel. |
| **2-Row Jumps (R1 ↔ R3)** | ≈1.0% to 2.0% | Minimizes difficult finger stretches that cross two rows. |
| **Total Pinky Workload** | 15.98% | Greatly reduced strain on pinky fingers due to lower engagement. |

## Installation / Setup

Developed on WindowsOS but can be used on any standard keyboard. 

The necessary files are provided in the [setup](/setup) directory. This includes a **.klc file** (Windows Keyboard Layout Creator) and Linux/macOS configuration files.

## Acknolwedgements

Shand Beyo is based on the design philosophy and initial key cluster separation pioneered by the Halmak layout.

Analysis of layout's efficiency was assisted by Google's Gemini.
